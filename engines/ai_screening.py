"""AI screening rules: the preset automation that clears a watchlist match
without an analyst, and the workflow label every KYC case carries as a
result.

This is a deterministic rule book, not a model. The client calls it "AI
automation rules" and the screens use that name; what runs is a short list
of checks a compliance team can read and audit. The rules run twice: at
intake, when the case is first screened (the seed does this while it builds
the case book), and again at the re-screen after Data Confirming, on the
name, date of birth and nationality the analyst confirmed.

Two workflows fall out of it (SOP: current automation and the client's
requirement of 2026-09-24):

    auto-verified        no match on any list, or every alert cleared by the
                         rules. The screening case closes itself, an export
                         is recorded as evidence, and (workflow.auto_verify)
                         an individual's case completes with no analyst step.
    human-in-the-loop    at least one alert the rules could not clear. The
                         analyst handles only what is left.

Rails that are not switchable: a rule only fires when both values are
present; a record that shares the client's exact date of birth always goes
to a person; a resolution an analyst recorded is never changed; the rules
only ever clear a record as a false positive.

Imports vocab, dates and the watchlist console's export helper only, so the
seed can run it while building cases and workflow.py can call it at the
re-screen without a cycle.
