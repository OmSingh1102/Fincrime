"""The KYC case state machine.

Every analyst action on a case is a function here. Each one validates the
state it needs, refuses with a WorkflowError it does not, mutates the record
in place, and appends an audit event — so nothing changes on a case without a
line in its history saying who did it and why. The routes stay thin: gather
the form, call one of these, save, redirect.

Two rules the earlier prototype got wrong are enforced here on purpose:
every outcome needs the analyst's own comment (nothing is ever written into
the audit trail on their behalf — the router and the AI screening rules sign
their own rows as themselves), and `reviewers_by_level` is append-only so
the segregation check still knows who touched a case at L1 after it has been
returned and picked up by somebody else.

The AI screening rules (engines/ai_screening) run again at the re-screen
after Data Confirming. An individual's case they leave nothing on is auto-verified
here without an analyst step; a business always keeps its human close.

Ownership changes also keep the work log (engines/worklog) and, on every
tier hand-off, ask the router (engines/routing) for the next analyst at
once — SOP 5.2.3, no bot lag.
