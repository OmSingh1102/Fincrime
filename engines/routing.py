"""Automated case routing — the hub's replacement for bot allocation plus
manual self-assignment (SOP 5.2: end-to-end routing, dynamic capacity and
case on-demand, immediate hand-offs between tiers).

A case has requirements (tenant, tier, document script, KYB); an analyst has
a skill book (tenants, roles, scripts, KYB) and a capacity. The router gives
a case to the least-loaded analyst who is eligible — same tenant, holds the
tier's role, has the skills, is not blocked by segregation at that tier, and
has free capacity. Every decision lands in the case's audit trail with the
reason, so a lead can always answer "why did this case go there?".

The module is bound to the live case book once at boot (configure()). It
never imports app.py or workflow.py: workflow imports it for hand-offs.
