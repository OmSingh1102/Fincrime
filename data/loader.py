"""Fresh copies of the seed for boot and for reset.

SEED_VERSION is stamped in the state store at boot, together with the case
book. Bump it whenever a builder's output shape changes — a stored record
from an older shape would be missing keys the templates read, and clearing
the store is the honest answer.

Two case books (CONSOLE_CASES in the environment picks one; app.py reads it):
"file", the default, is the 1,000 cases of the reconciliation log
(fincrime/data/recon_book.py); "demo" is the nineteen scripted scenarios and
the filler rows the test suite and the original walkthrough use.
